Privacy Policy for the Pinboard-Pin Add-On
==========================================

This add-on communicates with the [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) service using the [Pinboard API](https://pinboard.in/api) for the purpose of storing and updating bookmarks in your personal Pinboard account.

In order to access your personal Pinboard account, your personal Pinboard API token is requested by the add-on and cached locally until you log out using the add-on. Your Pinboard password is not requested, accessed or stored by the add-on.

In order to provide suggestions for tagging bookmarks, the add-on retrieves your tags stored in your personal Pinboard account using the Pinboard API and caches these tags locally.

The data sent to the Pinboard service are the URL of the bookmarked link, its title, description, tags, and privacy and read status on Pinboard.

If you activate the option "always check and show whether pages have been bookmarked" (which is deactivated by default), then the add-on checks for every tab whether it has been already bookmarked. For this purpose, it sends the URL of the tab to the Pinboard service using the Pinboard API.

Please also read the [Pinboard privacy policy](https://pinboard.in/privacy/) for information on the privacy police of the Pinboard service itself.

The author of this add-on is not affiliated with the Pinboard service in any way and does not take any responsibility for how the service handles your bookmarks.
